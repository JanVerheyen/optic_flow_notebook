    "# Deriving the optical flow formula\n",
    "Each point in an image $(x, y)$ has an associated optical flow $(u, v)$. Here we will derive an expression for the optical flow in terms of the movement of the camera, translational velocities $(U, V, W)$ and rotation rates $(A,B,C)$, and the coordinate of the projected point in the real world, $(X, Y, Z)$. This derivation is based on [2], from which we adopt the notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use the coordinate system as introduced in [2], which is shown in Figure 1. In the system, O represents the center of the camera, $X$ is positive toward the left, $Y$ positive up, and $Z$ is positive in the direction of the cameraâ€™s principal axis.\n",

    "We start with the formulas for the image coordinate of a world point $P$ at $(X, Y, Z)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x = \\frac{X}{Z}$ and $y = \\frac{Y}{Z}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where the reader should note that $x$ and $y$ are _normalized_ image coordinates. The optical flow then is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$u = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} x = \\dot{x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$v = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} y = \\dot{y}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we first express $\\dot{x}$ and $\\dot{y}$ in the variables representing the camera movement and $P$'s coordinate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{x} = \\frac{\\dot{X}}{Z} - \\frac{X \\dot{Z}}{Z^2}$      (Eq. 1),\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\dot{y} = \\frac{\\dot{Y}}{Z} - \\frac{Y \\dot{Z}}{Z^2}$      (Eq. 2),\n",
    "\n",
    "which shows that we should find the expressions for $\\dot{X}$, $\\dot{Y}$ and $\\dot{Z}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will determine the time derivative of $x$, as the derivation of $\\dot{y}$ is similar. Let us start with $\\dot{X}$, which captures the change in coordinate $X$ as measured from the camera's origin over time. Obviously, if the camera has a positive velocity $U$, in its own reference frame the (static) point $P$ will move with the same velocity in the other direction. So:\n",

    "\n",
    "Furthermore, a rotation around the $Y$-axis ($B$) also has an effect on the change in coordinate $X$. Please look at Figure 2, depicting a point P that is rotated with a rotation rate $B$. First, we can express $X$ and $Z$ in terms of the angle $\\beta$ and distance of P to the origin, $R$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$X = R \\mathrm{cos}(\\beta)$, and $Z = R \\mathrm{sin}(\\beta)$.\n",

    "Then we can determine $\\dot{X}$ as:\n",

    "$\\dot{X} = \\dot{R} \\mathrm{cos}(\\beta) - R \\mathrm{sin}(\\beta) \\dot{\\beta}$,\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\dot{X} = - R \\mathrm{sin}(\\beta) B = -B Z$,\n",

    "$\\dot{X} = -U -BZ + \\ldots$\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar reasoning (left as exercise for the student) leads to the addition of $+CY$. The derivations for $\\dot{Y}$ are also similar, with as result:\n",

    "$u = \\dot{x} = -\\frac{U}{Z} - B + Cy + x \\frac{W}{Z} + A x y - B x^2$,\n",
