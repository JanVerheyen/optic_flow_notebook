    "# Optical flow for control\n",
    "In this notebook, we will study how we can determine ego-motion and structure with the help of optical flow from an image sequence. We assume a pinhole camera in this notebook. We first start with a theoretical derivation of the optical flow formulas (expressing the optical flow in terms of ego-motion and structure of the observed scene). Then we will discuss how structure and ego-motion can be obtained from these formulas. Finally, you can play with a Python script that determines important optical flow observables such as the divergence from an image sequence."

This derivation is based on [2], from which we adopt the notation.\n",
