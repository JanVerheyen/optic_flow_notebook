    "# Optical flow for control\n",
    "In this notebook, we will study how we can determine ego-motion and structure with the help of optical flow from an image sequence. We assume a pinhole camera in this notebook. We first start with a theoretical derivation of the optical flow formulas (expressing the optical flow in terms of ego-motion and structure of the observed scene). Then we will discuss how structure and ego-motion can be obtained from these formulas. Finally, you can play with a Python script that determines important optical flow observables such as the divergence from an image sequence."

    "## Deriving the optical flow formula\n",
    "Each point in an image $(x, y)$ has an associated optical flow $(u, v)$. Here we will derive an expression for the optical flow in terms of the movement of the camera, translational velocities $(U, V, W)$ and rotation rates $(A,B,C)$, and the coordinate of the projected point in the real world, $(X, Y, Z)$. This derivation is based on [2], from which we adopt the notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use the coordinate system as introduced in [2], which is shown in Figure 1. In the system, O represents the center of the camera, $X$ is positive toward the left, $Y$ positive up, and $Z$ is positive in the direction of the cameraâ€™s principal axis.\n",
